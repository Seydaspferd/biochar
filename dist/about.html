            Biochar is charcoal used as a soil amendment. Biochar is a stable
            solid, rich in carbon, and can endure in soil for thousands of
            years. Like most charcoal, biochar is made from biomass via
            pyrolysis. Biochar is under investigation as an approach to carbon
            sequestration, as it has the potential to help mitigate climate
            change. Independently, biochar can increase soil fertility of acidic
            soils (low pH soils), increase agricultural productivity, and
            provide protection against some foliar and soil-borne diseases.

          <h3>Benefits</h3>

          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>The pyrolysis of forest- or agriculture-derived biomass residue generates a biofuel without competition with crop production.</li>
              <li>Biochar is a pyrolysis byproduct that may be ploughed into soils in crop fields to enhance their fertility and stability, and for medium- to long-term carbon sequestration in these soils. It has meant a remarkable improvement in tropical soils showing positive effects in increasing soil fertility and in improving disease resistance in West European Soils.</li>
              <li>Biochar enhances the natural process: the biosphere captures CO2, especially through plant production, but only a small portion is stably sequestered for a relatively long time (soil, wood, etc.).</li>
              <li>Biomass production to obtain biofuels and biochar for carbon sequestration in the soil is a carbon-negative process, i.e. more CO2 is removed from the atmosphere than released, thus enabling long-term sequestration.</li>
            </ul>
